# IDEATE
We at IDEATE are building a group of students who share our interests in the UI-UX field.
 Here, we'll host activities that encourage students to apply design aesthetics and discover ways to improve their experience.
This is for folks who enjoy learning new things and keeping up with emerging technology.

Here, you can build software from scratch and learn how to combine technical and creative abilities.
a group of like-minded people who are passionate about keeping up with emerging technical developments and are interested in UI/UX.

Create, assemble, and comprehend software

Design and oversee the events!
